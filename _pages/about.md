I am a dedicated researcher specializing in Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML), with a focus on event-based deep learning for healthcare applications. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Ghent University, where my dissertation centered on quantifying uncertainty and improving the reliability of time-series-based deep learning models. I have a strong background in machine learning, with experience spanning academia and industry, including a tenure as a Machine Learning Engineer at <https://robovision.ai>, where I developed real-world AI solutions. My postdoctoral work focuses on advancing state-of-the-art methodologies for healthcare diagnostics.
