I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML), with a focus on healthcare applications. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Ghent University in 2022, where my dissertation centered on quantifying uncertainty and improving the reliability of time-series-based deep learning models. I have a strong background in machine learning, with experience spanning academia and industry. My postdoctoral work focuses on advancing state-of-the-art methodologies for healthcare diagnostics. I am open to talks, please contact me on one of the channels shown on the left.
